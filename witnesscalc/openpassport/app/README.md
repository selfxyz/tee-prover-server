## Installation

```bash
yarn install-app
```

## Run the app

First, connect your phone to your computer and allow access.

### Android

Create the file `android/local.properties` with the following content:

```
sdk.dir=/Users/<your-user-name>/Library/Android/sdk
```

Launch the react-native server:

```
yarn start
```

Press `a` to open the app on Android.

To see the Android logs you'll have to use the Android Studio Logcat.

**EDIT**: to test the app on android, see [this issue](https://github.com/zk-passport/openpassport/issues/191) temporarily

### iOS

> :warning: To run the app on iOS, you will need a paying Apple Developer account. Free accounts can't run apps that use NFC reading.<br/>
> Contact us if you need it to contribute.

Open the ios project on Xcode and add your provisionning profile in Targets > OpenPassport > Signing and Capabilities

Then, install pods:

```
cd ios
pod install
```

And run the app in Xcode.

## Modify the circuits

If you want to modify the circuits, you'll have to adapt a few things.

First, go to the `circuit` folder of the monorepo, modify the circuits and build them.

Then, upload the zipped zkeys and dat files at publicly available urls and replace the urls in `app/src/utils/zkeyDownload.ts`.

Adapt the input generation in `common/src/utils/generateInputs.ts`, and adapt and redeploy the contracts.

### Android

Find your android ndk path. It should be something like `/Users/<your-user-name>/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/23.1.7779620`
Build the android native module:

```
export ANDROID_NDK="<your-android-ndk-path>"
./scripts/build_android_module.sh
```

### iOS

Find your [development team id](https://chat.openai.com/share/9d52c37f-d9da-4a62-acb9-9e4ee8179f95) and run:

```
export DEVELOPMENT_TEAM="<your-development-team-id>"
./scripts/build_ios_module.sh
```

## Export a new release

### Android

#### Export as apk

```
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The built apk it located at `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

#### Publish on the Play Store

As explained [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/signed-apk-android), first setup `android/app/my-upload-key.keystore` and the private vars in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, then run:

```
npx react-native build-android --mode=release
```

This builds `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`.

Then to test the release on an android phone, delete the previous version of the app and run:

```
yarn android --mode release
```

Don't forget to bump `versionCode` in `android/app/build.gradle`.

### iOS

In Xcode, go to `Product>Archive` then follow the flow.

Don't forget to bump the build number.
